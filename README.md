# Final-Project
Final project for Programming for IT
Hayden Bean
The main idea of the project is to create a contact page that allows you to add contacts and see specific information about those contacts with a GUI. It will have features more than just contact information, that allow you to create groups of contacts that may be related to each other.  

This program uses TKinter to create a GUI that shows you a list of contacts based on your special pin, and allows you to add more contacts.
In this project I used covered file management and manipulation, using lists, using loops, using conditionals, and using functions.
The most challenging part about this project was trying to get the frames and labels to fit in the right place using TKinter.
I used the online textbook for everything except for TKinter. To learn TKinter I used this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt6SqWuMSA8 and this video series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJB1Ek2Ko_Y

Instructions:
I suggest putting this program in a folder because it will make extra text files that will store the pin and the contacts for that pin.
1. Open up the project
2. Either register a new pin or login using yours
3. Hit refresh to view your current contacts
4. Enter in information and hit add to add in a new contact

Future work:
If I had more time to work on this project I would want to try and find a way to remove contacts from the file.
